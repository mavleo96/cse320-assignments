USAGE: bin/transplant [-h] -s|-d [-c] [-p DIR]
   -h       Help: displays this help menu.
   -s       Serialize: traverse tree of files, output serialized data.
   -d       Deserialize: read serialized data, reconstruct tree of files.
            Optional additional parameter for both -s and -d:
               -p DIR       DIR is a pathname that specifies the source directory
                            for serialization or the target directory for deserialization.
                            If this parameter is not present, the pathname `.`
                            (referring to the current working directory) is assumed.
            Optional additional parameter for -d:
               -c           ``clobber'': the program will overwrite existing files,
                            rather than terminating with an error, and it will ignore
                            errors that result when attempts is made to create directories
                            that already exist.
